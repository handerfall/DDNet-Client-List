# DDNet-Client-List

### [T-Client](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet)

Tater Client is a Client originally made by [sjrc6](https://github.com/sjrc6/)
The Client exists because Tater wanted some features that DDNet Devs did not intend on adding.
It has a bunch of usefull features like a bindwheel, Outlines for Tiles, Player indicators and more.

### [Chillerbot-ux](https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux)

Chillerbot-ux is one if not the first client to feature ChatCommands and a Warlist made by [chillerbot](https://github.com/chillerbot)
Chillerbot has alot of features that either dont fit in a client like DDNet.
It's main feature is the Warlist but it also features features like auto reply, tabbed out reply, skin stealer and more.

### [A-Client](https://github.com/qxdFox/Aiodob-Client-DDNet)

Aiodob Client is a client that is supposed to be a *whacky* open source version of cactus client made by [qxdFox](https://github.com/qxdFox/)
It has features *copied* from T-client and chillerbot to sort of make a public version of cactus.
its main features are the same as T-Clients and Chillerbots, but also features like Freeze kill or Auto Kill, which kills the player if an enemy is sitting ontop of you while you are frozen

### [StA](https://github.com/StormAxs/StA-Main)

StA is a Client *supported* by [StormAx](https://github.com/StormAxs), meloƞ and Mʎɹ. It's source code is on [StormAxs](https://github.com/StormAxs) Github
StA feautures Console Visual Customization, Tablist Customization, PlayerAssets (T-Client), a *different* version of Bindwheel and some more stuff.

### [Duck-DDNet](https://github.com/Ar1gin/duck-ddnet)

Duck-ddnet is a client by [Ar1gin](https://github.com/Ar1gin).
It adds little visual features like a timer when you hook someone, icons above nameplates to show what *abilities* a tee has (e.g Jetpack), and Grenade and Laser Prediction

### S-Client

S-Client is a Client all about Customization made by [Sedonya](https://github.com/Sedonya/) and also is Closed-Source for some unknown Reason.
it adds a very simple type of war/team list using the Friend/Foe system that already is in the Client.
it has a bunch of customization options for the chat, tab and other stuff.

### [Cactus Client](https://cactuss.me/)

Cactus is a closed-source client for who knows what reason made by a russian developer
It reworks the Warlist originally by Chillerbot and adds a bunch of new features like freeze kill
Since it's closed source I personally do not recommend downloading it.

### [AllTheHax](https://allthehaxx.github.io/)

AllTheHax is an old DDNet client that is no longer in Development
It has a bunch of Features that almost no Client today has, for example: Lua API, Built-in IRC client to chat with other client users, ingame chat translator, crypted chat and a bnuch more
The Client might be considered cheating, use it at your own risk

### KRX-Client

Straight up Cheat Client, do not download it, it contains malware.
