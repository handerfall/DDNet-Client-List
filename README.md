### [T-Client](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet)

- Tater Client is a Client originally made by [sjrc6](https://github.com/sjrc6/).
- The Client exists because Tater wanted some features that DDNet Devs did not intend on adding.
- It has a bunch of usefull features like a bindwheel, Outlines for Tiles, Player indicators and more.

### [Chillerbot-ux](https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux)

- Chillerbot-ux is one of, if not the first client to feature Chat Commands and a Warlist made by [chillerbot](https://github.com/chillerbot)
- Chillerbot has alot of features that dont fit in a client like DDNet.
- It's main feature is the Warlist but it also has features like auto reply, tabbed out reply, skin stealer and more.

### [A-Client](https://github.com/qxdFox/Aiodob-Client-DDNet)

- Aiodob Client is a client that is supposed to be a *whacky* open source version of cactus client made by [qxdFox](https://github.com/qxdFox/)
- It has features *copied* from T-client and chillerbot to sort of make a public version of cactus.
- its main features are the same as T-Clients and Chillerbots, but also features like Freeze kill or Auto Kill, which kills the player if an enemy is sitting ontop of you while you are frozen.

### [DDNet-sm64](https://github.com/headshot2017/ddnet-sm64)

- DDNet-super mario 64 is a client that features a whole new playable character: Mario, and is made by [headshot2017](https://github.com/headshot2017).
- Mario is fully playable, even though a bit hard to control in 2d since it was a 3d game, it also adds soundtracks from sm64.

### [StA](https://github.com/StormAxs/StA-Main)

- StA is a Client made by [StormAx](https://github.com/StormAxs), and been supported by melon. It's source code is on [StormAxs](https://github.com/StormAxs) Github.
- StA feautures Console Visual Customization, Tablist Customization, PlayerAssets (T-Client), a *different* version of Bindwheel and some more stuff.

### [Duck-DDNet](https://github.com/Ar1gin/duck-ddnet)

- Duck-ddnet is a client by [Ar1gin](https://github.com/Ar1gin).
- It adds little visual features like a timer when you hook someone, icons above nameplates to show what *abilities* a tee has (e.g Jetpack), and Grenade and Laser Prediction

### [S-Client](https://ddnet.ru/)

- S-Client is a Client all about Customization made by [Sedonya](https://github.com/Sedonya/) and also is Closed-Source for some unknown Reason.
- it adds a very simple type of war/team list using the Friend/Foe system that already exists in the DDNet Client.
- it has a bunch of customization options for the chat, tab and other stuff.
- Since it's closed source I personally do not recommend downloading it.

### [Cactus Client](https://cactuss.me/)

- Cactus is a closed-source client for who knows what reason made by a russian developer.
- It reworks the Warlist originally by Chillerbot and adds a bunch of new features like freeze kill.
- Since it's closed source I personally do not recommend downloading it.

### [AllTheHax](https://allthehaxx.github.io/)

- AllTheHax is an old DDNet client that is no longer in Development.
- It has a bunch of Features that almost no Client today has, for example: Lua API, Built-in IRC client to chat with other client users, ingame chat translator, crypted chat and a bunch more.
- The Client might be considered cheating, use it at your own risk.
